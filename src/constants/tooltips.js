  sweetness: 'Sweetness is how much sugar you taste in the wine. A dry wine has almost no sugar and feels more serious or crisp A sweet wine has natural sugar and feels smooth and dessert-like. There are also in-between levels, like semi-sweet.',
  acidity: `Acidity is what makes the wine feel fresh, lively, or zesty. It’s like the feeling you get from a lemon or a green apple. A wine with more acidity is more refreshing. A wine with less acidity is more smooth or flat.`,
  tannin: `Tannins are what make the wine feel dry or rough in your mouth. They come from the grape skin, seeds, and sometimes the barrels. It’s like drinking strong black tea or eating a green banana — it dries your mouth.`,
  body: `The body of the wine is how it feels in your mouth. It can be light like water, medium like milk, or heavy like cream. It depends on the alcohol, sugars, and other elements in the wine.`,
  persistence: `Persistence is how long the flavor of the wine stays in your mouth after you swallow. If the taste disappears quickly, it has short persistence. If the flavor stays for several seconds, it has good persistence.`
